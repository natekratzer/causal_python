    "What if we control for occupation? (This is usually suggested when workplaces are facing gender discrimination lawsuits). Remember that we set up occupation to also be impacted by discrimination. So when we add this as a control, the sign actually flips, and all of a sudden it seems like being female leads to higher wages. We know that's not correct in our simulated universe of data - so what happened? The causal model implied in this regression is wrong. It suggests causation runs from occupation to wages and that there's nothing else that also impacts both occupation and wages. However, ability and discrimination also impact occupation and wages, and we're not currently conditioning the model on ability. "

Nonetheless, the way the sign flips back and forth depending on the model is hopefully an illustration of why it's so important to have a theoretical model and not just throw in as much data as possible.
